# Sequence Detector Design Verification

The verification environment is setup using [Vyoma's UpTickPro](https://vyomasystems.com) provided for the hackathon.!

## Verification Environment

The [CoCoTb](https://www.cocotb.org/) based Python test is developed as explained. The test drives inputs to the Design Under Test (Sequence Detector module here) which takes   '''inp_bit, reset, clk''' as the input and '''seq_seen''' as the output.

The clk and the reset signal are generated by:
```
@cocotb.test()
async def test_seq_bug1(dut):
    """Test for seq detection """

    clock = Clock(dut.clk, 10, units="us")  # Create a 10us period clock on port clk
    cocotb.start_soon(clock.start())        # Start the clock

    # reset
    dut.reset.value = 1
    await FallingEdge(dut.clk)  
    dut.reset.value = 0
    await FallingEdge(dut.clk)
    binstream = ''
    binstream2 = ''
    out=0
    count=0
```

A random input signal is generated:
```  for i in range(31):
        await FallingEdge(dut.clk)
        INP = random.randint(0, 1)
```
The following code snippet is used to generated the expected output:
```
 dut.inp_bit.value = INP
        binstream2 = binstream2 + str(INP)
        if '1011' in binstream and count==4:
            out = 1
            binstream = ''
            count = 0
        else:
            out = 0
            if ('101' in binstream and INP==1 and count==3) or ('10' in binstream and INP==1 and count==2) or ('1' in binstream and INP==0 and count==1) or (INP==1 and count==0):
                count=count+1
                binstream = binstream + str(INP)
            else:
                binstream = ''
                count=0
```
The assert statement is used for comparing the sequence detector's output to the expected value.


## Test Scenario **(Important)**
Random test cases:
### Test Scenario 1.

### Test Scenario 2.

## Design Bug

No error/bug has been identified in this design from functional point of view.

## Design Fix

As no error has been identified, the design need not be fixed.


## Verification Strategy
We have used cocotb design environment and wrote the testbench in python.

There is involvement of clock as the DUT is sequential.
## Is the verification complete ?
Yes, the verification is complete as we have verified the design for all the possible test-cases.
